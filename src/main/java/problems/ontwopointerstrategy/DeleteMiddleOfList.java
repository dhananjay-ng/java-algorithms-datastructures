    /***
     * Given a singly linked list, delete middle  of the linked list. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5
     *
     * If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element. For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.
     *
     * If the input linked list is NULL, then it shoudl remain NULL.
     *
     * If the input linked list has 1 node, then this node should be deleted and new head should be returned.
     *
     * Input:
     * You have to complete the method which takes one argument: the head of the linked list. You should not read any input from stdin/console.
     * The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list.
     * There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.
     *
     * Output:
     * Your function should return head  of the modified linked list.  If linked list is empty then it should return NULL.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * 1 <=T<= 50
     * 1 <=N<= 1000
     * 1 <=value<= 1000
     *
     * Example:
     * Input:
     * 2
     * 5
     * 1 2 3 4 5
     * 6
     * 2 4 6 7 5 1
     *
     * Output:
     * 1 2 4 5
     * 2 4 6 5 1
